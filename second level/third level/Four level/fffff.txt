hahahahPrinciple of categoring complcated case:
1.) If repository (either Private or Public) has no copyright notice and contain unknown contibutors , it belongs to case 9.

For the repository highlighted in yellow, I need more information before further action.  These repositories could be classified by following feature:

1.a) Repository has no copyright notice, but under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Anthropomorphic-Robot-Hand and Sophia-Head are belong to this type. So I guess HR cannot own this repository's copyright?

1.b) Repository has no copyright notice, but under Apache License 2.0.  relex is belongs to this type.   So I guess HR cannot own this repository's copyright?

2.) The repository is empty.  I suppose we don't need further action for these repositories? 

3.) The repository is under "Unlicense".  In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors
of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the
software to the public domain.  pau2csv is belongs to this type.
So I guess HR cannot own this repository's copyright?  

4.) Repo, cogutils, contains 3 license documents. In LICENSE.AGPL, there is a copyright notice, Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>.  Can I consider the copyright is belongs to other organisation (which is case 7 for further action) ?

5.) Repository contains unidenified HR member who are not listed in contractors list.  As I mentioned before, repository with unknown contribtors and no copyright notice would be considered as case 9.  And I believe case 9 would cost highrt efort.  Therefore, it would be great if a repository is 100% contibuted by HR members.  I discovered that there are 5 possible repositories, BaccaratDealer, baccarat_embeded, robosapien, CharacterEngine, MotionOrchestrator, that maybe 100% contributed by HR members. Some of the contribtors claim themselves are HR member but not in the contractors list. Their names are as follow ([] is github account name):
[SGSSGene]
[nerdmaennchen] = Lutz Freitag
[N-zewge]
[DrDavidHanson]
[dackley1935]
If they are really HR member and work in HK/US, we can put these repositories as case 3 and do simpler action.  Can  you confirm their identity for me?
